        <p> Dehydration means your body does not have as much water and fluids as it should. Dehydration can be caused by losing too much fluid
            , not drinking enough water or fluids, or a combination of both. 
            The most common cause of dehydration in infants and children is loss through vomiting and diarrhea from a virus.
            Because of their smaller body weights and higher turnover rates for water and electrolytes, 
            infants and children are more susceptible to dehydration than adults.
             The elderly and those with an illness are also at higher risk.</p>
